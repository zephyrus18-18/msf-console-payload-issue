# msf-console-payload-issue
i have used the evil droid to make a payload by rebuilding apk file of flappy bird and the payload is also crfeated but when i open the msfconsole and set the payload then after going to the ip page on my android device to install the payload the ip page is not opening its basically not loading however when i put the port no also with the ip then in the msfconsole it shows session died and cant open it i have tried all the ways to create a payload from msfvenom to apktool but i always got stuck at the time when it comes to install it in the android device
